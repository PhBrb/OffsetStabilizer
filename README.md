Firmware for laser offset stabilization using [![Stabilizer](https://github.com/sinara-hw/Stabilizer)]

Forked from https://github.com/quartiq/stabilizer

# Description
This firmware repurposes pins to use them as beat signal and reference clock inputs.

TIM1 (Pin PE7 / GPIO Pin 6) is a reference timer that triggers the readout of TIM8 (Pin PA0 / GPIO Pin 18). TIM8 counts the beat signal. The count gets fed into the IIR filter by replacing the ADC signal.

# Example Setup
A beat signal was generated from two NKT Adjustik fiber lasers at 1560 nm using a 50:50 fiber splitter, a Thorlabs FGA01FC photodiode, a Mini-Circuits ZX85-12G-S+ bias tee, and a Mini-Circuits ZX60-14LN-S+ amplifier.

The analog beat signal was digitized and divided by 6 using an AD9513 evaluation board, which was powered by the 3.3 V output of the Stabilizer.

A Sinara Urukul module produced the reference signal, and a bias tee shifted this signal to positive voltages.

One laser operated in a free-running mode, while the wavelength modulation input of the other laser was connected to the Stabilizerâ€™s output, with modulation range set to narrow.

The reference frequency was adjusted from 10 MHz to 8.9 MHz, jumping the target beat frequency from 600 MHz to 543 MHz. In a frequency-doubled Rb87 setup, this roughly corresponds to a jump from MOT to Grey Molasses cooling frequencies.

With this setup the laser frequency step response reached 99.6% of the target frequency within 1ms. This corresponds to < 4.5 MHz difference after frequency doubling.

# Limitations

- The reference frequency is different from the update rate of the IIR filter. This causes the spikes on the output voltage signal.
- The reference frequency can only be changed in a small range, as the optimal IIR parameters depend on it. This could be improved by using an internal reference and establishing a fast communication to the stabilizer, to control the frequency setpoint.
- The upper limit of the beat frequency is 150 MHz. As of the STM32H743 datasheet this could be improved by using a different timer setup, but would require more firmware changes and/or exposing different pins on the PCB.
